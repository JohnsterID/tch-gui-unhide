# An SSID moved to another interface (Local Network > Wi-Fi Networks, or any other change of a wifi-iface
# "network" option). netifd reads that option only at a network reload, which the stock commitapply rule for
# wireless does not run. The reload can also leave the SSID's old interface up on the SSID's device
# (on a DJA0231 with 20.3.c, in 16 of 32 test moves of a guest SSID): netifd keeps the link although the
# old interface no longer names the SSID. Such an interface has no device of its own any more, so take it
# down, and note it. An interface noted that way is brought back up as soon as it has a device again: an SSID
# names it, or it lists a device in ifname ("recover" runs only that part, after an interface's ifname changes).
# Runs in the background, so that the rest of the commit and apply carries on.
